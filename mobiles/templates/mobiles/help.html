        <h3>Important note on unscribing and block lists</h3>
        <p>It is critical that individuals can block their mobiles from receiving unwanted text messages.</p>
        <p>This is enforced by our SMS provider (currently Twilio). If you send a text to STOP, UNSUBSCRIBE, CANCEL, END or QUIT,
        then no further messages will be sent to your phone. Textivist will receive notice of this, but has no ability
        to override it.</p>
        <p>There is also a STOPALL command - it might be nice to apply this to all a given users subscriptions. Currently,
            Twilio only applies the block per endpoint.</p>
        <p>You can send a START, YES or UNSTOP text to start receiving messages again.</p>
        <h2>SMS Commands</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>REGISTER: Will create new Textivist account if not present, and add membership to endpoint's org.</li>
            <li>SET <i>(Firstname Lastname)</i>: Registers your name to the mobile</li>
            <li>SET OWNER <i>(Firstname Lastname)</i>: Registers your name to the mobile</li>
